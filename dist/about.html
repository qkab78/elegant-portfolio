                <p>
                    I created a backend API with NodeJS and MongoDB. It is a social media mobile application called
                    <i>Plaiz</i>. I integrated user and posts managment features. I also worked on linking my API to the App
                    with React Native and Redux.

                <p>
                    I created from scrath the entire web application. It is a platform where you can book online participation at courses in Paris.
                    With this formation, you can learn the job of being a Model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This web application is built with NodeJS, ReactJS and MongoDB.

                <p>
                    I worked on several applications built in NodeJS and VueJS.<br/>
                    I was in a team of 11 developers and each of us had to manage the team by being a Scrum Master for each Sprint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked on implementing new features and also fixing bugs by doing hotfix. We used to switch between backend, frontend and testing (E2E) developments.

                <p>
                    I worked with 2 other developers on two projects : Maintanance of the current web application and Creation from scratch of the new web application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I fixed bugs and added new features (espacially in the frontend side of the app) but when the other project came around, 
                    we had to come up with new technologies and a new system in order to build a efficient and fast web application.
                    To do that, we chose technologies like NodeJS, ReactJS, Redux, gRPC and PostgreSQL.

                    I worked on the backend and the frontend of many web applications. I used PHP in order to create new features and used a
                    javascript UI framework called
                    <i>Webix</i> to build great UIs.
